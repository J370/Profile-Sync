After a week of trial and error, I am please to announce our first beta build, 1.5.0 (don't ask about the others) to be published for all to criticise and utilise. Our extension currently applies to all browsers supporting the chrome store and is targetted at Google Contacts users. If you see this blog, there's a high possibility that you came from the about page. If you are hesitating or want to find out more, click the 'About' button conveniently placed on the top right of this page ;) for more details. Do share with your family and friends if you think they can find use in this extension. You know what, even if they can't find any use in it, just share with them. There's no harm in a file that is less than 50kB, you never know when you might need it.
