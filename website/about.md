## Who are we
ðŸ“¢ Attention all Android users
 
Ever come across the issue where you do not know who is whom in your contact book? Most of us are visual learners and recognise an individual by the photo. How convenient it is then that Whatsapp has the contact photos that could help aid in this endeavor. Unfortunately, Whatsapp doesnâ€™t provide this feature. Here is where Profile Image Sync comes to the rescue, our extension helps you to do exactly that. This initiative is open source so feel free to contribute. Details are below.
